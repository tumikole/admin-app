# admin-app

On my admin app, i started by structuring the front page by putting the form which has the first name, last name, Identity number, work position and salary.

I added another HTML page where theres a table, all the information from the form are stored in the table on another HTML page.
I added a nav-bar which has a header that has the title of the app, and also a button (Stuff Member) that leads to the table page where the information from the form are stored.

I also added javaScript file that execute functions for storing information to the table. Another function that stores the information to the LocalStorage, converting the objects to the Strings and also getting the information from the localStorage to display on table.
